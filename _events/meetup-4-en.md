Sweden is since 2011 part of the Open Government Partnership (OGP), an international collaboration bringing together government reformers and civil society to promote transparency and inclusivity.

The government is developing its fourth action plan describing how the work towards fulfilling its commitments will proceed, and it will be released before summer. Since OGP is about the interrelation between civil society and government, we invite you to join us for a meetup so anyone interested will get the chance to express their opinions and suggest new ideas.

Are there areas in which you think the government is lacking in their efforts of transparency? Is there data you need published to be able to monitor the public administration? Do you wish your opinion should be taken into account more often?

Bring your proposals!

Unfortunately, it will probably be too late to inspire major changes in the content of the coming plan, but we hope to start a more long-term process to get innovative ideas and requests from civil society and make sure that the government makes concrete commitments to fight corruption and promote more participation.

## Program
* 18.00 What is OGP?
* 18.15 Sweden's OGP plans to date (Alina Ostling, independent expert)
* 18.40 The government presents its draft
* 19.15 Proposals for improvement
* 20.15 Possibility of continuing the conversation at a bar

 Hope to see you there!
