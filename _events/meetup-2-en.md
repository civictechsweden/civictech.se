Learn to code by making your first website! When you’ve got the foundation in place, your imagination is the only limitation. No prior knowledge is needed to participate. This event is exclusive for women and non-binary people.

We meet at 18 on <a href="https://lifeatcapsule.com/">Capsule</a>, Smedsgränd 4, and the workshop starts at 18.30. The workshop is held by Victoria Wagman who works as a developer at 46elks. You are welcome to stay and work on your site afterwards if you want to.

If you can; bring a laptop. If you don’t have one; show up anyway! There are some laptops you can borrow, and also the opportunity to share a laptop with someone else.

If you already know how to how to make code you are welcome to join us as well and work on your own project or help out if needed.

We will provide fika. Hope to see you there!
