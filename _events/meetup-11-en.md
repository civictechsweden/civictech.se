We start out with presentations on approaches to increase privacy both as a user of YouTube and generally as an internet user. We will finish with a workshop on hardening the Firefox web browser.

Bring your laptops/smartphones! In small groups we'll help each other to install, configure, and get to know tools for improved digital privacy, anonymity, and security. Possible topics: privacy-enhanced or anonymous browsing, encrypted mail or chat, disk encryption, password managers, mobile security, free operating systems, and more.
