### **Welcome to our 2-part lab about climate assemblies!**

Climate assemblies is a method where randomly selected citizens deliberate, meet experts and develop concrete recommendations for governments. They do not replace elected officials, but because they are composed of **citizens from all walks of life**, research shows that they can come up with new solutions and manage to reach a wider consensus.

We start on Tuesday with everything you need to know about climate assemblies and continue with a hands-on workshop on Thursday!

#### **When**

18 and 20 May 2021.

**Part 1.** 18 May 2021 09:00-12:00 CEST \[UTC+2\]

What are citizens assemblies, why are they important and how can they help our democracy? Background and panel discussion. Part 1 is in English, read more below.

**Part 2.** 20 May 2021 09:00-12:00 CEST \[UTC+2\]

How do we create a climate assembly? Hands-on workshop based on the kind of assemblies you want. Part 2 is in Swedish, read more below.

#### **Where**

This lab is part of Open Gov Week which this year is digital, wherever you are.

The lab is free to join and you will get a Zoom-link after you sign up. Sign up here: länk till eventbrite

#### **The entry point for this lab**

We are in a climate crisis and we need solutions.

An increasingly popular method for finding solutions are **Citizens’ assemblies** or panels. These assemblies deliberate, meet experts and develop concrete recommendations for governments. They do not replace elected officials, but because they are composed of randomly **sorted citizens that are demographically representative**, research shows that they can come up with new solutions and manage to reach a wider consensus.

Countries such as **Denmark, France, the UK**, or municipalities such as **Trondheim** and **Warsaw** have already organised climate assemblies and many more are currently taking place.

In Sweden, thousands participated in **Klimatriksdagen's** process in 2018 where anyone could **suggest, debate and vote motions** that were sent to the parliament.

Our aim for this lab is to gather climate and government experts to explore the potential benefits of climate assemblies in Sweden.

##### **Part 1.** 18 May 2021 09:00-12:00 CEST \[UTC+2\]**  
  
What are climate assemblies, why are they important and how can they help our democracy? (with Klimatriksdagen and organisers of the Danish Climate Assembly, in English)**

On the **18th of May**, we are inviting the **Danish Board of Technology**, which led the facilitation of the Danish climate assembly, and **Klimatriksdagen** to present their work. In a panel discussion they will discuss the citizen-led processes they organised. What did they achieve, what are their limits? Could Sweden benefit from more citizen participation to tackle climate change? What can citizens assemblies bring to the picture?

###### **Agenda:**

* Introduction
* Experiences from the Danish Climate Assembly (15 min)
* Experiences from Klimatriksdagen (15 min)
* Pause (5 min)
* Panel discussion with questions from the public (40 min)
* Conclusion

##### **Part 2.** 20 May 2021 09:00-12:00 CEST \[UTC+2\]

How do we create a climate assembly? (with Digidem Lab, in Swedish)**

On the **20th of May**, we roll our sleeves up and put you behind the wheel. What **questions** would your climate assembly answer? What would be its **mandate**? How would you recruit the **participants**? How would it be **facilitated**?

This practical part of the lab will be facilitated by participation experts from **Digidem Lab**. It will be in Swedish and is **designed primarily for government officials and civil society organisations that wish to organise a climate assembly.** To make the most of your time, we ask you to attend part 1 or to watch the recording before participating in this practical session.

#### **Who can participate?**

All are invited and you can participate from wherever you are in the world. Part 1 is in English and Part 2 is in Swedish.

We want action, not just inspiration. We encourage you to bring more people from your organisation or cause so you can implement together what you have learned. We also recommend that you reach out to a local enabler or decision maker, like a local politician, who can help in making your assembly happen. Ask them if they want to join the lab together with you.

#### **Facilitators**

**Sanna Ghotbi** is co-founder and citizen participation expert at Digidem Lab. A former member of the Gothenburg city council, she now helps cities and public institutions in Sweden and around the world in designing participation processes that include citizens with the least decision making power and combining them with digital tools. She was part of the team designing the citizen assembly for the city of Madrid.

**Pierre Mesure** is an expert in citizen participation and digital democracy at Digidem Lab. Pierre is deeply involved in the development of the Swedish and international civic tech ecosystem, an advocate, speaker and trainer in the field of open government.

**Digidem Lab** is an independent democracy lab. It is currently working with cities such as Stockholm, Göteborg in Sweden or New York, Chicago and the EU commission internationally. It aims at bringing the most innovative methods and tools for participatory democracy to Sweden through an active participation in civic tech networks and international research projects such as COLDIGIT.

#### **Open Gov Week**

Open Gov Week takes place from May 17 to May 21 and is designed for anyone who believes citizens should play a role in shaping the policies that affect their lives.
