The government's goal is that "Sweden will be best in the world at using digitalisation's opportunities". But in a field as central as open data, we are still struggling to follow the pace of the frontrunning countries.

Right now, the government has started three assignments which could play a big role in open data's development in our country. To help them with it, Civic Tech Sweden is organising a meetup where representants from these 3 assignments can meet anyone interested in the future of open data in Sweden.

So come to Goto10 in Stockholm (Hammarby kaj 10D) on the 4th of February and help us to solve the equation!

To introduce the evening, we will have Mélanie Robert, executive director of the OpenGov team of the Canadian government, who will tell her about the journey that lead her country to become a leader in open data and what they learnt on the way.

We'll also try to leave enough room to ask questions and discuss.

Please do register either on Facebook or [Goto10.se](https://www.goto10.se/evenemang/civic-tech-sthlm-11-fokus-pa-oppna-data/) so we have an idea of how many are coming.
There will be snacks and drinks.
And in case you can't make it, we will stream the event on [Goto10's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK5k7hsVwA_QZiSbRrQlW6Q)
