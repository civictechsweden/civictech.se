There will be a presentation explaining DNS and discussing DNS-over-HTTPS, followed by discussions, that are led by your interest.

Bring your laptops/smartphones! In small groups we'll help each other to install, configure, and get to know tools for improved digital privacy, anonymity, and security. Possible topics: privacy-enhanced or anonymous browsing, encrypted mail or chat, disk encryption, password managers, mobile security, free operating systems, and more.
