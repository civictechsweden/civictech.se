The science of climate is clear. Our planet is warming up due to human activity and the release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To reduce these emissions requires a deep and rapid change in the way we live as individuals and as societies. At the same time, our world is becoming more digital and we now have huge amounts of data to describe our impact on the planet. Can this data be exploited to take smarter and greener decisions?

Civic Tech Sweden invites you to an exciting discussion with some of the people trying to use this data to save our climate.

**Clara Guibourg** from [J++](https://jplusplus.org/en/)/[Newsworthy](https://www.newsworthy.se/en/) is a datajournalist who works on how to better report on climate change using data.

**Johan Eklöf**, co-founder of [Klimatsekretariatet](http://klimatsekretariatet.se/), builds tools to increase citizen awareness about their impact.

**Olivier Corradi**, co-founder of [Tomorrow](https://www.tmrow.com/), builds tools helping companies to optimise their energy consumption.

In addition to a presentation of their work and a panel discussion, this event will also feature an open discussion with the audience so don’t hesitate to come with your questions and ideas!

The event will be moderated by **Malin Crona** and **Pierre Mesure**.

The event will be virtual via Zoom and rewatchable on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK5k7hsVwA_QZiSbRrQlW6Q "Goto 10 YouTube channel"). Registration is done through [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.se/e/webinar-how-can-data-help-fight-climate-change-tickets-124542966365).

You're welcome to join the Zoom webinar from 13:45 CEST to chat with the other participants, and to stay up to 30 minutes afterwards.

You are also welcome to join the [#climate](https://chat.civictech.se/channel/climate) channel on [https://chat.civictech.se/channel/climate](https://chat.civictech.se/channel/climate "https://chat.civictech.se/channel/climate") both before and after the webinar to chat with others about climate related civic tech!
