Do you want to grow a community with the help of digital tools? This lab is for you! We will both see examples, talk about best practices and try out tools during the lab. The lab is free to join and all you have to do is sign up. After you have signed up we will also send you stickers and chocolate in the mail! Sign up here: [https://www.eventbrite.com/x/140276682333/](https://www.eventbrite.com/x/140276682333/ "https://www.eventbrite.com/x/140276682333/")

Civic Tech Sweden is the growing community in Sweden for people working with technology for the common good and digital tools for community + democracy + transparency. During 2021 we will have labs on different subjects and before, in between and after we'll talk about them and much more in our forum: [https://forum.civictech.se/](https://forum.civictech.se/ "https://forum.civictech.se/")

**The entry point for this lab**

People already talk about your organisation or your subjects in one way or another. So the question is not “should we have a community or not?”. Rather the question is in what way you can lean in to the existing conversations about your organisation or subjects. This is our entry point for the lab, and together we will explore this!

**Facilitators**

Pernilla Näsfors Östmar and Mattias Jägerskog who both have decades of experience with community building in Sweden.

**Special guest**

Hugi Ásgeirsson is an instigator of participatory places, events, and communities who likes to make decentralized communities tick and tock. He's a co-founder at [Blivande](https://forum.blivande.com/t/civic-tech-lab-community-tools-23-february-2021-9-12-am-cet/1936), co-director of [Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/t/civic-tech-lab-community-tools-23-february-2021-9-12-am-cet/15360) and project manager for the civic tech project [Plato](https://www.platoproject.org/).

**Who can participate?**

This is an open lab for everyone. We encourage participation from at least two people from the same organisation or project in the lab, so that you can work together on exercises and better support your organisation to absorb and apply what you learn. However, if only one can come that is off course fine.

**Program**

* We start at 09.00 on Zoom and will be done before lunch at 12.00.
* We love conversation and doing! The lab will have lots of time for conversations between participants.
* Real examples rather than theoretic. Our focus is for you to be able to implement what you learn both during and after the lab.

The program is right now under development in our forum. We believe in transparent conversation and would love to hear your thoughts about Community Tools right now.
