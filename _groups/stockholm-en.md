Right now, there are no regular meetups planned in Stockholm but it's easy to organise one! Send a mail to [hello@civictech.se](mailto:hello@civictech.se) or a message in the [Matrix-chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#civictechse:matrix.org) if you'd like to see things happen and you'll find like-minded people that can organise an event with you!
