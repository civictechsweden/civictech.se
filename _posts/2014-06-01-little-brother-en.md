In 2014, DFRI organized a translation of Cory Doctorow's book "Little Brother." Anyone who was comfortable reading English and writing in Swedish could participate in the translation project, which was conducted through crowdsourcing.

The book is about a society where the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Security Agency, and other agencies have been given free rein to surveil society.

However, a few young people begin to defend themselves against the abuses and take matters into their own hands.
