## Summary

Karrot is a sleek and user-friendly open-source tool where people can coordinate pickups to save food from being wasted and to share it freely. It is used by many grassroots initiatives around the world and by Solikyl in Gothenburg, the one making most use of it. Solikyl has at least six regular pickups a week on Karrot, and a couple of tons of food are rescued and distributed every month through a system of community fridges. However, more work is needed on Karrot to help scale up the foodsaving projects using it.

## Tasks and Challenges

Karrot is under constant development and there is a roadmap for the development of many important features that are missing in order to improve user experience and to build community, such as notifications or a peer-to-peer food sharing feature. The choice of tasks, regardless of the priority on the roadmap, is up to the group formed in this hackaton and the skills of participants involved.

## Technical specs

Django (Python) on the backend and Vue.js (Javascript) on the frontend.
