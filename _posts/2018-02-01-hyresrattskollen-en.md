A website by Allt åt alla Göteborg to keep track of tenancy prices and acknowledge conflicts.

The website has been active for a long time, and now we want to change focus from individual tenants to bigger conflicts.

We want to create a comprehensive picture of the situation for tenants in relation to their landlords by collecting stories of for example evictions and publish those stories on the website.

## Technical specs
The current map is built on Leaflet/JavaScript but we are planing to redo the concept a bit. Our hope is to get help with design and development.
