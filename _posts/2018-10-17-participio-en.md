Participio was a development lab within Edgeryders, funded by the Swedish arts council fund Kulturbryggan. Our purpose was to build experimental software and methodology for decentralized organizations and co-created culture. Everything built by Participio is open-source and free to use. Cobudget was one of the projects that came out of the Participio Labs.
