  text: During her studies in design, Agnese joined the Foodsharing movement in Gothenburg
    and aimed to explore how design thinking, tools and methods could be used in the
    activism against food waste. Now she is looking for new ways on how the concept
    of sharing could be spread further and deeper, and how design can help it happen.

Gothenburg needs an open-source gifting/sharing platform! Thousands of people are already sharing and gifting at give-away groups on Facebook or other smaller websites that are based on closed systems of classified ads, such as bortskankes.se. However, none of these tools have a nice user experience nor the features for sharing both within closed groups (say, among friends or within an organization) and sharing openly with the public. There is no open-source alternative out there for this type of sharing economy to reach its potential.

## Skills required

During this occasion we’ll try out different design methods and evaluate existing tools, and we’ll work mostly on design and user experience. People with this particular background are most welcome, but also backend and frontend developers for consultation and to start playing with code (there’s an ambition to build from Karrot’s backend). People who are already engaged in gifting and sharing practices using existing tools are also invited for this participatory design process.

## Who

This project is an initiative of people with know-how in local sharing groups and is supported by officials in the city of Gothenburg and The Gothenburg Region Association of Local Authorities who are interested in seeking finance for its development, in order to promote a more sustainable use of resources.
