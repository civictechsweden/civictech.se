We are a non-profit project with the goal of providing a pleasant and rewarding community for all Linux enthusiasts. For us, it's important that everyone—regardless of their level of knowledge—feels just as welcome as anyone else!

We are 100% open source. The services we provide and advocate for are and will always be based on open software.

We take personal privacy seriously. For us, personal privacy is important, and therefore it's obvious that only ethical software based on open source is what we stand for.

If you have any questions or concerns about your personal privacy, we recommend that you read our very uncomplicated privacy policy or simply contact us with your questions.

Linuxkompis is truly free. We will never charge for anything, and our goal is never to make money from our project. We do this because it's fun and because we are passionate about Linux and open source.
