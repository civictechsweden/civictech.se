OpenStreetMap Sweden is the Swedish mappers community on OpenStreetMap. Anyone is welcome to contribute or join the many projects and mapathons.

A good start is to join the [mailing list](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo/talk-se), another one is to check out the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/osmsweden/) where hackathons are regularly advertised. The [Wiki page](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Sweden#Aktuella_projekt) also gives a good overview of what projects are active.
