[**Open Up!**](https://openup.okfn.se) is a project of [Open Knowledge Sweden](http://se.okfn.org) that helps public organisations to publish open data about their purchases and any other actor that wants to reuse it.

Are you working for local or national government in Sweden? Then our project can help your organisation to save time and resources and create innovative new services by publishing your procurement data!

If you're a journalist, a researcher, a company or just a curious citizen looking to reuse some of this data, we can also help you get started!

Read more on the project website ([openup.okfn.se](https://openup.okfn.se)) and come to our forum thread to talk with more actors taking part in the project!
