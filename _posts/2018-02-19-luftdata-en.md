The goal of luftdata.se is to provide knowledge on how to build your own measuring station for airborne particles in order to contribute open data to the Citizen Science initiative luftdaten.info, which is the idea behind luftdata.se.

There are several different projects that measure air quality with the engaged citizen as the starting point. Luftdata.se chose to build on the platform (hardware and software) developed by luftdaten.info due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, the large existing user base (over 5000 active measuring stations), and the flexibility to contribute data to other projects such as openSenseMap.

The content on luftdata.se is partially based on luftdaten.info. Luftdata.se is the Swedish sister project of luftdaten.info.
