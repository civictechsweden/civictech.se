Wikidata is a central storage for structured data for all the Wikimedia projects, including Wikipedia. It can be freely queried and edited and it uses standards which make it easy to compare data internationally and manipulate it.

For now, the imported data has been linked to uses from other projects such as OpenRemiss, Handlingar or Din Riksdag.

The Swedish community for Wikidata is very active and all the projects are listed [here](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Sweden).
