We are friends and friends of friends. We’re getting closer to each other. When we’re going the same direction we offer our spare seats to each other in buses, boats, cars, bicycles and hot air balloons. We share the costs of our rides equally or offer rides for free, because friends don’t make money of friends. Read more about the movement in the app! Open Source, Free, Participatory.

The project [Skjutsgruppen](https://skjutsgruppen.se) is from Sweden and has about 100 000 users.

You can join the movement too and [create an account](https://resor.skjutsgruppen.se/bli-medlem).
